# Sponsoring and Specific Feature Requests

This project has mostly been developed by Torbj√∂rn Einarsson at [Eyevinn Technology][Eyevinn].

DASH-IF has sponsored Eyevinn Technology to develop livesim2 and migrate the old
Python-based livesim to livesim2 during Aug-Oct 2023.
Since then, there has been financial sponsoring for maintenance from DASH-IF and more
lately from SVTA as DASH-IF is now part of SVTA corresponding to rougly 2hours/week.

During the DASH-IF face2face meeting in Berlin in June 2024, it was discussed that the development of quite a few
features should be supported, with a common priority of issues between dash.js and livesim2.

However, it is also possible to directly sponsor the project if you have a specific interest. For that, you
can contact [Eyevinn] directly.

Other standardization/industry fora are also welcome to sponsor this project
via DASH-IF or by direct contract with [Eyeinn].
